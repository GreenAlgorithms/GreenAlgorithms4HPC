# Run Green Algorithms on Alma
To run green algorithms, you have to log into Alma and run the following command:

```console
/data/rds/DIT/SCICOM/SCRSE/shared/apps/GreenAlgorithms4HPC/run_GA_Alma.sh
```

You will see a GreenAlgorithms terminal output for your account starting from beginning of this year.
