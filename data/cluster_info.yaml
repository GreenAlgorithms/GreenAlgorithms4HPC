institution: "<My institution>" # [str]
cluster_name: "<My cluster name>" # [str]
granularity_memory_request: <6> # [number] in GB representing the smallest memory unit users can reserve
partitions: # a list of the different partitions on the cluster
  <partition name_1>: # name of the partition
    type: <CPU> # [CPU or GPU]
    model: "<Intel XXX>" # [str] the model of the processing core on this partition. Not actually used by the code but useful for reference for others.

  <partition name_2>: # name of the partition
    type: <GPU> # [CPU or GPU]
    model: "<NVIDIA XXX>" # [str] the model of the processing core on this partition. Not actually used by the code but useful for reference for others.
    TDP: <250> # [number] For GPUs, the TDP is for the entire GPU
    # For GPU partitions, we also need info about the CPUs available for support.
